# Gulp-template

This is the new and improved gulpfile adjusted for use in assorted projects.
Local environment variables are set in the file **environment.json**, which by default is gitignored. An example configuration file is included as environment-default.json, remember to adjust and rename accordingly.

Browsersync is included. It is by default set to proxy a server at localhost:9999, change this to match your local dev environment in environment.json.

This is a work in progress.
